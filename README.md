# 🎬 GSAP Animations Playground

Welcome to my **GSAP Animations Playground** — a personal collection of interactive projects built using [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://gsap.com/), primarily with **React** and **Next.js**. This repository exists as both a **learning space** and a **showcase** of my growing expertise in animation and modern frontend development.

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository

This repo is dedicated to:

-   Practicing advanced animations using GSAP
-   Exploring creative UI/UX interactions
-   Enhancing my understanding of performant and expressive animations
-   Building a portfolio of fun, dynamic projects that demonstrate animation control and logic
-   Sharing knowledge and inspiring others who want to use GSAP in modern frameworks like React or Next.js

Whether it's a landing page, a scroll-based scene, a hover interaction, or a dynamic intro animation — you’ll find a variety of implementations here, each as its own standalone folder with its own README and code.
