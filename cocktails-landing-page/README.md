# üç∏ Cocktails Landing Page

This is a visually engaging **landing page for a fictional cocktail brand**, built with **Next.js** and **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**.

This project is based on the tutorial from **Next.js Mastery** and was recreated to **practice GSAP fundamentals**, improve animation logic, and understand how to integrate advanced scroll animations into a Next.js app.
